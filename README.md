## Overview of Analysis
### Overview
The Purpose of our Analysis in this module is to utilize matploylib to display the ride sharing data within a community of rural, suburban, and urban communities. We further look to break it down by total number of drivers in the area and the avg fare per ride and driver in each type of community. What we look to do is ultimately see what business opportunities can be identified in each type of community in regards to driver quantity and fare price.
